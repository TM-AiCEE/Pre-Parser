# Pre-Parser

This repo contains a Visual Studio 2017 "solution" folder structure with one project subfolder called "ParseUserLog", which purpose is to
parse the AI contest "Texas Holdem" game server log into a more processable form. The programming language used is C# 7.3.1.

To compile it, simply download the exact same folder structure to your local disk, open the "ParseUserLog.sln" file with your
